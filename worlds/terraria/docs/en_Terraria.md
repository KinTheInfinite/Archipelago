# Terraria

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure
and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Recipes are unable to be crafted from certain tiers (copper, iron, adamantite, etc) and shuffled into the item pool as
progressional upgrades. Health and mana increases are also shuffled into the item pool as progressional upgrades.
You can receive progressional upgrades as well as crates that can drop items and make it easier to clear the game. 
Optionally traps can be randomized into the item pool for a more difficult and hectic experience.

## What is considered a location check in minecraft?

Location checks in are completed when the player completes various Terraria achievements, or when they gain
progressional health and mana increases. You will be given a book in-game on connecting to the server containing
the list of checks you have yet to complete.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item in Terraria, it either unlocks crafting recipes or puts items into the player's
inventory directly. In the event of a full inventory it will be dropped onto the ground (hope you weren't above lava).

## What is the victory condition?

Victory is achieved when the player kills the Wall of Flesh or Moon Lord (depending on setting).
