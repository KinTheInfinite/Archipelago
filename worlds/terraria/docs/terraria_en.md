# Terraria Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- Archipelago Terraria from
  the Terraria Workshop on Steam's tModLoader

## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

See the guide on setting up a basic YAML at the Archipelago setup
guide: [Basic Multiworld Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en)

### Where do I get a YAML file?

you can customize your settings by visiting the [Terraria Player Settings Page](/games/Terraria/player-settings).

### Connect to the MultiServer

Use tModLoader 1.4 and create a singleplayer world with any character.

Once you are in game type `/connect <AP-Address> (Port) (Password)` where `<AP-Address>` is the address of the
Archipelago server. `(Port)` is only required if the Archipelago server is not using the default port of

38281. `(Password)` is only required if the Archipelago server you are using has a password set.

### Play the game

Once you have connected you will receieve a book in your inventory containing the checks you have yet to complete.
If you save and exit from the world you will need to run the connect command again.

## Manual Installation

Download the Archipelago Terraria mod off the github, and put it in your tModLoader mods folder.
